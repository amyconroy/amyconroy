👋 Hi, I'm Amy! I'm a Data Scientist and Legal NLP researcher. 

🎓 I started my path to LegalTech when studying my LLB, before going on to do my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

📝 I'm a published Legal NLP researcher, my research focuses on the applicability of traditional NLP methods to legal texts. This includes the creation of a system to automatically summarise UK court judgments, created for my MSc thesis. 

💻 I currently work as a Data Scientist for Mishcon de Reya LLP ([MDR Research](https://github.com/mdrresearch)), focusing on the way we can leverage litigation data to improve and provide better insights into the way the firm operates. I also work on external projects leveraging my NLP experience to contribute to the wider research community. 

🏫 I am the co-founder of [Law School 2.0](https://www.lawschool2-0.com/), a Legal edTech that focuses on improving education for future lawyers around LegalTech and legal innovation with a focus on problem identification, solution creation, and solution adoption. We run various events, including a one week long summer vacation scheme.
