### Heya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Amy](https://www.amyconroy.co.uk), an LLB graduate and MSc Computer Science Conversion student at the University of Bristol. I'm currently working on the automatic summarisation of UKHL legal judgments using supervised machine learning for my MSc thesis. I am also the co-founder of [Open Tenancy](https://github.com/open-tenancy), an open source platform to enhance access to justice by providing clear and accessible tenancy advice - coming soon. 

When I'm not coding, I love figure skating, reading, and creative writing! 

I am now working as Legal Engineer at Avvoka during the day, and on openTenancy at night. I love talking about Legal Tech and all things under the sun really, feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to have a virtual coffee at amyeileenconroy@gmail.com. ðŸ‘¯ðŸ˜„âœ¨
