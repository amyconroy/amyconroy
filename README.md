### Heya! ðŸ‘‹

I'm [Amy](https://www.amyconroy.co.uk), an LLB and MSc Computer Science grad from the University of Bristol. I'm a Data Scientist and NLP researcher, currently working on the SUMO system. The system automatically summarises UKHL legal judgments using supervised machine learning. Our first paper on this system was published as part of the JURIX 2020 conference proceedings.

When I'm not coding, I love figure skating, reading, and creative writing! 

I love talking about Legal Tech and all things under the sun really, feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to have a virtual coffee at amyeileenconroy@gmail.com. ðŸ‘¯ðŸ˜„âœ¨
